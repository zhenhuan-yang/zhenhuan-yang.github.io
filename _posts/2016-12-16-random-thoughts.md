I believe topologists and statisticians are the most creative mathematician. Don't get me wrong, I am not either of them. If you ever studied graduate level of mathematics, you will agree with me that topology is the freest subject of math (I realized this when I was studying topological data analysis). Yet, not everyone will agree that statistics is creative. But wait, here it is why.

I have been working in the field of differential privacy, basically developing better privacy bound or utility bound. Yet I do not understand the motivation of DP. Turns out to understand differential privacy you need to understand what is differential attack.
