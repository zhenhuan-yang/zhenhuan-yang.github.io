*Atom*! Basically, I like following cool features

* Direct Git and Github support.

* Built-in package manager and loads of open-source packages.

* It is Free!

Yes *Sublime* has larger user's group, but the growth has slow down. Embrace the future and use *Atom*!

Yet, I will still use my *Texpad* for Tex editing, and *Pycharm* + *Anaconda* for Python coding. But for Markdown and more general tasks, *Atom* is the choice!
