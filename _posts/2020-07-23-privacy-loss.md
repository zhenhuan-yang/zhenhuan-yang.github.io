After reading so many papers about the application of differential privacy on machine learning, a nature question is raised in my mind:

*"So my algorithm is $\epsilon$-DP, but what does it mean?"*

This is an intimidating question at first since I don't know exactly 

*"What does differential privacy [guarantee](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf)?"*

 In fact the answer to this question is not that hard if you know some basic probability theory, Bayes' rule to be more specific.
