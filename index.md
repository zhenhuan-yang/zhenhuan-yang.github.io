I finish my Ph.D. from [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Yiming Ying](https://www.albany.edu/~yy298919/). Before that I got my B.S. from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), under the supervision of [Prof. Yuesheng Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sOkv66IAAAAJ). My research interests span broadly in optimization and statistics informed machine learning problems.
